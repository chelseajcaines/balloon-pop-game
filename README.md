## Balloon Pop

### Description

Balloon Pop is a fun word puzzle game where the player guesses one letter per turn to try to figure out the puzzle based on the category chosen. If a player guesses a letter correctly, great--keep going. If a player guesses a letter wrong, one of the player's precious balloons pop, and the player only has six balloons!

If a player figures out the puzzle before all of their balloons are popped, they win the game and has the option to continue playing or leave the game. The player will also win points that depend on how many balloons are left when the puzzle is guessed correctly. Ex: If the player wins the game with two balloons left, they win two points.

After each consecutive win, the new points won are added to the previous points and the player's overall current score is increased. If a player loses a game during their winning streak, their current score is knocked back to zero but their highest current score they managed to achieved before losing may get posted to the top ten leaderboard! (Single Player mode only).

Puzzle categories include:

-   Movie Titles
-   Phrases
-   Food
-   Brand Names

Within each category are 200 puzzles. Local Storage is used to keep track of what puzzles are played, so that the player does not play the same puzzle more than once during a game session.

Some other fun features to the game include:

-   Sound Effects - With the option to turn them on or off.
-   Avatars - Choose your player! Each comes with their own silly name and back story.
-   Animations - The balloon popping animations are files I drew and created myself using ProCreate on my iPad
-   Dark Mode - With the option to go back and forth to light mode when the player desires.
-   Single Player - Try your best to get the longest winning streak!
-   Two Player - Battle your friend for most wins! Turns alternate when a player guesses wrong.
-   Mouse and Keyboard functionallity - Use the mouse or keyboard to navigate and play the game!

### Motivation

I love games; boardgames, video games, card games.. you name it. I am also interested in dabbling in all sorts of fields of development so building a game was definitely up there on my to do list. I went with a word puzzle game becuase it is my favourite type of game to play on my phone :D.
