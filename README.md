### Description

Balloon Pop is a fun word puzzle game where the player guesses one letter per turn to try to figure out the puzzle based on the category chosen. If a player guesses a letter correctly, great--keep going. If a player guesses a letter wrong, one of the player's precious balloons pop, and the player only has six balloons!

Some fun features include:

🔊   Sound Effects - With the option to turn them on or off.
🐱   Avatars - Choose your player! Each comes with their own silly name and back story.
🎉   Animations - The balloon popping animations are files I drew and created myself using ProCreate on my iPad
🌙   Dark Mode - With the option to go back and forth to light mode when the player desires.
🎈   Single Player - Try your best to get the longest winning streak!
⚔️   Two Player - Battle your friend for most wins! Turns alternate when a player guesses wrong.
⌨️ 🖱️   Mouse and Keyboard functionallity - Use the mouse or keyboard to navigate and play the game!

### Motivation

I love games; boardgames, video games, card games.. you name it. I am also interested in touching on all sorts of fields of development so building a game was definitely up there on my to do list. I went with a word puzzle game becuase it is my favourite type of game to play on my phone :D.
